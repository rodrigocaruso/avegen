I did this simple map generator for Avenue "roll & write" game. 

It does not kill your printer ink and it is B/W for easy copy, 4 little sheets per page.
No private property was used on this generator, like images, I have used shapes of triangles and circles for castles and grapes. Farms are only the respective letter.
If follows certain rules, like castles are always opposed, farms never touch other farms or castles, etc.

Don't mind the dirty code, as it was a purelly experimental project.


Test it online:

Just inform at most 8 characters and it generates a map based on what you typed. If it is a good map you can print again using the same characters.
